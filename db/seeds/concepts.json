You can put a value inside it, and then refer to that value by the container's name whenever you need it.\n\n```javascript\nlet age = 25;\nlet name = \"Alex\";\n```\n\n## Why Use Variables?\n\n1. **Reusability**: Store a value once and use it many times\n2. **Clarity**: Give meaningful names to values\n3. **Flexibility**: Change the value in one place, update everywhere\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n// Store a number\nlet score = 100;\n\n// Store text\nlet greeting = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n// Use the variable\nconsole.log(greeting); // Outputs: Hello, world!\n\n// Update the variable\nscore = score + 10;\nconsole.log(score); // Outputs: 110\n```\n\nVariables are fundamental to programming and you'll use them in almost every program you write!",
